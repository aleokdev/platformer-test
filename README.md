# Platformer test
![Screenshot](Screenshot.png)
A platformer template made in Rust, using `bevy` as its engine and `ldtk_rust` for loading levels.

May evolve into a game at some point; This repo is going to serve as the base for one of my future projects.

## Controls
Left & Right arrow keys OR left controller stick: Move left/right respectively
Space OR south action button: Jump (Hold to jump higher)
You can rebind these controls by modifying `assets/input.ron`.

You can press Ctrl+I to bring up the player properties window.

If the "jumps available" setting is over 1, you can press the jump button in midair to jump again.

If the "wall sliding" setting is enabled, you can slide down walls simply by touching them once. You
can stop sliding by moving on the opposite direction.

If the "wall jumping" setting is enabled, press the jump button while sliding down a wall to perform
a walljump.
